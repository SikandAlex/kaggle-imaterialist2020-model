# AmoebaNet-D on TPU

This code was implemented based on results in the AmoebaNet paper, which should
be cited as: Real, E., Aggarwal, A., Huang, Y. and Le, Q.V., 2018. Regularized
Evolution for Image Classifier Architecture Search. arXiv preprint
arXiv:1802.01548.


## Acknowledgements

The starting point for this code was branched from the implementation for NASNet
in https://github.com/tensorflow/models/tree/master/research/slim/nets/nasnet
and from image processing code in
https://github.com/tensorflow/tpu/blob/master/models/experimental/inception/inception_preprocessing.py.


## Prerequisites

### Setup a Google Cloud project

Follow the instructions at the [Quickstart Guide](https://cloud.google.com/tpu/docs/quickstart)
to get a GCE VM with access to Cloud TPU.

To run this model, you will need:

* A GCE VM instance with an associated Cloud TPU resource
* A GCS bucket to store your training checkpoints
* (Optional): The ImageNet training and validation data preprocessed into
  TFRecord format, and stored in GCS.

### Formatting the data

The data is expected to be formatted in TFRecord format, as generated by [this
script](https://github.com/tensorflow/tpu/blob/master/tools/datasets/imagenet_to_gcs.py).

If you do not have ImageNet dataset prepared, you can use a randomly generated
fake dataset to test the model. It is located at
`gs://cloud-tpu-test-datasets/fake_imagenet`.


## Training the model

Train the model by executing the following command (substituting the appropriate
values):

```
python amoeba_net.py \
  --tpu_name=$TPU_NAME \
  --data_dir=$DATA_DIR \
  --model_dir=$MODEL_DIR
```

TODO: this Python command is not complete. Though ideally, most flags should be
good by default.

If you are not running this script on a GCE VM in the same project and zone as
your Cloud TPU, you will need to add the `--project` and `--zone` flags
specifying the corresponding values for the Cloud TPU you'd like to use.

This will train an AmoebaNet-D model on ImageNet with 1024 batch size on a
single Cloud TPU. With the default flags on everything, the model should train
to above 80% accuracy in under 48 hours (including evaluation time every
few epochs).

You can launch TensorBoard (e.g. `tensorboard -logdir=$MODEL_DIR`) to view loss
curves and other metadata regarding your training run. (Note: if you launch
on your VM, be sure to configure ssh port forwarding or the GCE firewall rules
appropriately.)

### About the model and training regime

The model is the result of evolutionary neural architecture search presented
in [Regularized Evolution for Image Classifier
Search](https://arxiv.org/abs/1802.01548).
